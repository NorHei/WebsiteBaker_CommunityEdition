     Problem is in mediacenter, because the mediasettings only exist, when at least one time the mediaoptions are stored. So storing the options will end up this notice until an new folder is created.
     One idea for solving this would be to check if mediasettings for a folder do exist:
     upload.php line 102

     This reverts commit 98bda74703228b4271b3cc00f856d479884fe216.

     if(($addon['directory'] == DEFAULT_TEMPLATE) ? $selected = ' selected="selected"' : $selected = '');

   > Activated autoloader + Some cleanup in Initialize.
     Autoloader is now activated and available .
     And i did some cleanup to initialize.php
     Still there is lots of work to do.
     
     The autoloader now loads most WB libraries on autopilot.
     /framework/ folder is searched and some includes are Set right now.
     Twig and PHP mailer load their own autoloader.
     
     To register a new directory:
     WbAuto::AddDir("/classes/somewhere/");
     
     Register a special file (very fast plus you can load non standard conform stuff):
     WbAuto::AddFile("MultiCrud","/classes/multicrud.php");
     
     Register a new search shemata:
     WbAuto::AddType("class.%s.inc.php");
     
     Register Vars are global and can be printed for debug:
     echo  "<pre>"; print_r(WbAuto::$Dirs); echo  "</pre>";
     echo  "<pre>"; print_r(WbAuto::$Files); echo  "</pre>";
     echo  "<pre>"; print_r(WbAuto::$Types); echo  "</pre>";
     
     So if you would like to offer a library module you simply can do :
     <?php WbAuto::AddDir("/mysnippit/classes/");
     in the include.php et voila you got a library module.

       to the button. If $_POST['admin_tools'] this will redirect to admin tools.
     
     - Several additional vars for path and other purpose:
       $modulePath     Path to this module directory
       $languagePath   Path to language files of this module
       $returnToTools  Url to return to generic tools page
       $returnUrl      Url for return link after saving AND for sending the form!
       $doSave         Set true if form is send
       $toolDir        Plain tool directory name like "maintainance_mode"
       $toolName       The name of the tool eg "Maintainance Mode"
     
       For automated detection of sent form the submit button needs to have
       name+id ="save_settings". (Optional ($_POST['action']) == 'save')
     
     - The following WB classes and Modules are included automatic so no need
       to try manual loading:
     
       config.php
       framework/initialize.php
       framework/class.wb.php
       framework/class.admin.php
       framework/functions.php
     
     - some really old admin tools try to load backend.css and backend.js manually,
       please remove this code as we no longer need to suppot  WB 2.6.x.
     
     - Flattened out the structure to have a more linear workflow.
     
     - Language files are noaded here(if they exist) and we use new way of
       loading so even if language file is incomplete in its translation
       it will simply display englisch text instead of an error.

   > Installation of new settings class
     As i tried to make a admin tool  for setting of maintainance mode, i realized
     that there is nothing for easy management of WBs system settings.
     You still have to do it manually.  But i remembered that some module where
     using some set_settings() get_settings() functions(e.g. jsadmin).
     So i did a deep thought an decided that it would be a good idea that the
     whole settings management would be a lot more fun it we got some dedicated
     functions to handle this.
     If we use constants we schould do it in a good and clean way, so i put a
     few lines together and would like to know if you got some more ideas
     i can put into this.
     
     // create or edit a setting
     Settings::Set("wb_new_setting","the value");
     
     // using a setting
     if (WB_NEW_SETTING =="the value") echo "Horay";
     
     // there is a get function but this is mostly used internal
     $myValue= Settings::Get ("wb_new_setting");
     
     // deleting
     Settings::Delete("wb_new_setting");
     
     // if used in modules please prepend (shortened)module name to avoid collisions
     Settings::Set("wysi_new_setting","another value");
     
     Please keep in mind that WB stores settings always as strings.

   > Adding a maintainance mode
     The Maintainance mode is activated by setting a constant in the config.php.
     
     define('WB_MAINTAINANCE_MODE', true);
     
     You can deactivate it by either deleting the line or by setting the mode
     to false.
     
     The default template for maintainance mode can be found in
     /templates/system/maintainance.tpl.php
     
     Any template can have a custom maintainance template placed in
     /templates/yourtemplate/system/maintainance.tpl.php
     
     At this time the maintainance mode is limited to use the default template
     set in website options in the backend.
     
     As a next step there will be an admintool that allows to set the mode from
     the backend.

   > Webadmin Filemnager
     Download from: https://gist.github.com/nic-o/1219610 as the original
     page (http://cker.name/webadmin/)had a disfunctional .zip file
     
     I added this opensource filemanager to remove files from the webspace
     that have been added by websitebaker whith invalid file and directory
     permissions on a Server that uses PHP as Apache module.
     
     On such a server it may happen that if you try to remove such files via
     FTP you may get a "insufficient permissions error". Thats because the
     files are created by the webserver under a user different from FTP user.
     
     Just copy this filemanager into the webroot of your page and call:
     
     www.yourdomain.com/webadmin.php
     
     !!! ATTENTION !!!
     Please keep in mind that this admintool also can be abused as a hacking
     tool (indeed its a pretty good one, almost a hackershell)
     So please remove it after use or install it into a password protected
     directory (Its not necessary to install it into webroot).
     Please be really carefull!

   > Fixed IDKEY in Secureform
     I still had problems whith Security warnings on pages that used alot of
     IDKEYS. For example if i tried to move a field in the basic form module
     i had one  Warning on in about 15 atempts.
     
     Another Problem: unused old IDKEYS where never deleted so session got
     spammed by idkeys.
     
     So i made a more unique ID, recursive checking for overlapping ids,
     added a tiemout for IDKEYS (same as for FTAN) and added a page parameter
     to instantly delete all keys from a pagecall if one is used.
     
     Last thing i added is an additional parameter that allows the use of
     IDKEYS whith ajax scripts. If this setting is used, the key is not
     removed and can be used multiple times. (this is a small security risk
     but nothing compared to the 1 in 16 chance to guess the key that we had
     before. )
     
     This is a patch from my old fork only tested on my local installation.
