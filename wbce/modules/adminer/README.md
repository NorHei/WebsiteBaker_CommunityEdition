Adminer Database Management for WBCE
=========================================
Adminer (http://www.adminer.org) database tool packed in a Websitebaker(CE) Admintool.

You hate PhpMyAdmin?   
This is the solution.   

Your Webhoster has no PhpMyAdmin?   
This is the solution.  

You dont want to log into half a dozen interfaces before you can manage the Database?  
This is the solution.  

But be warned you really can kill your whole installation whith this, plus all other DBs that you 
can access through your USER/Password combination. 

So please be carefull!!!


Adminer Themes 
------------------
You like to try some other themes. Just download them(adminer.css) on https://www.adminer.org/de/#extras and put
them in the "adminer" folder inside the module directory. (/modules/adminer/adminer/) right next to the
adminer.php

WBCE backend themes 
----------------------
This Module manually supports the WBCE 1.2.x to have extra templates for BE modules in the BE theme. 
They must be located in /BeThemeFolder/modules/adminer/templates/ 
and have the same name as the module templatefile (tool.tpl.php) in this case. 



Have Fun
